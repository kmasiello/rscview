```

```{r include=FALSE}
library(lubridate)

# Get the number of content items created last week
last_week <- df_full %>%
  filter(created_time >= today() - days(7))

# Get the number of content items created last month
last_month <- df_full %>%
  filter(created_time >= today() - days(30))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

# Bar plot of content items by type
df_full %>% 
  count(app_mode, sort = TRUE) %>%
  ggplot(aes(y = app_mode, x = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Number of Content Items by Type",
       x = "Content Count",
       y = "Content Type")+
